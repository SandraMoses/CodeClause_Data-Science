## This repository includes the 2 tasks done for CodeClause Data Science Internship.

### Task 1: Stock Market Prediction
For most stock investors, the favorite question is “How long should we hold a stock for?”. Every investor wants to know how not to act too fearful and too greedy. And not all of them have Warren Buffet to guide them at every stem. We’d suggest that you stop looking for him. Rather, build your stock market predictor with artificial intelligence tools like Machine Learning.


### Task 2: Wine Quality Prediction
On the weekend, most of us prefer having a fancy dinner with our loved ones. While the kids define a fancy dinner as one that has pasta, adults like to add a cherry on top by having a glass of red wine along with the Italian dish. But when it comes to shopping for that wine bottle, a few of us get confused about which is the best one to buy. Few believe the longer it has been fermented, the better it’ll taste. Few suggest relatively sweeter wines are good quality wines. To know a precise answer, you can try building your wine Quality Predictor.
